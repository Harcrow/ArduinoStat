Smart Thermostat

Beginning work on a digital thermostat.  This is to replace the round hockey
puck style thermostat the currently resides in my house.  I'm
going to train this device to react to night/day temperatures.  It will also
indicate when the thermostat is sending a signal to begin heating the building.
My hope is that this will simplify consuming less natrual gas.
